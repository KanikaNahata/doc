## Introduction 
 
BEAST offers a wide range of prior distributions that can be used for the parameters used in its models.
This page provides a description of and the rationale behind the default priors on each parameter of those standard models in BEAUti, with the goal of providing every parameter with a proper and reasonable prior. 

Complementing the parameter priors described here, we also provide a [page on coalescent priors](tree_priors), which offers possible choices to put a prior on the underlying tree and its branch lengths.
