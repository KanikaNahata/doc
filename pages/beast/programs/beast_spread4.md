## SPREAD4

SPREAD4 (Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics 4) is a major update to [SPREAD](spread) and [SpreaD3](spread3) and constitutes a package for analysis and visualization of pathogen phylogeographic reconstructions.

### Using SPREAD4

SPREAD4 can be accessed directly here: [https://spreadviz.org/](https://spreadviz.org/)

There is no need to install any software. You only need either a Google account or an e-mail address (and an internet connection) to make use of SPREAD4, which runs entirely online. The analyses that can be visualized in SPREAD are typically obtained using [BEAST](about). However, it can also accommodate input generated by other phylogenetic inference tools, as long as the nodes and branches are annotated using the compatible syntax.

SPREAD4 is compatible with popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Frequently asked questions

1. I do not have a locations file, where do I download it from? \
A:  https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/

2. How do I save my custom visualization(s)? \
A. Any custom visualization can be exported as a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file that can be used for publication-ready figures. 

[comment]: <> (A. not sure if you can store the visualized after customizing online in SPREAD... )

3. How can I share my visualizations with others? \

A. 

5. Why can I not see the transitions ? \
A. 


5. How do I change the colour of transitions from solid to a gradient ? \
A. 


6. How do I upload my own map ? \
A. 

7. Where can I find such a map? \ 
A. https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/

9. Why are my map locations inverted in the visualization? \
A. Longitude is X axis and Latitude is the Y-axis

10. How do I view my transitions as missiles ? \
A. When the transition drop-down is viewed, toggle `missiles` to the right to view transitions as missiles.
