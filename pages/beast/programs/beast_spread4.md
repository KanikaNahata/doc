## SPREAD4

SPREAD4 (Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics 4) is a major update to [SPREAD](spread) and [SpreaD3](spread3) and constitutes a package for analysis and visualisation of pathogen pylodynamic reconstructions.

### Using SPREAD4

SPREAD4 can be accessed directly here: [https://spreadviz.org/](https://spreadviz.org/)

There is no need to install any software. You only need either a Google account or an e-mail address (and an internet connection) to make use of SPREAD4, which runs entirely online. The analyses that can be visualized in SPREAD are typically obtained using [BEAST](about). However, it can also accommodate input generated by other phylogenetic inference tools, as long as the nodes and branches are annotated using the compatible syntax.

SPREAD4 is compatible with popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
