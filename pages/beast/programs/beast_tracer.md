Tracer (now at version 1.7) is a software package for visualising and analysing the MCMC trace files generated through Bayesian phylogenetic inference. 
Tracer provides kernel density estimation, multivariate visualisation, demographic trajectory reconstruction, conditional posterior distribution summary and more.
Tracer 1.7 can read output files from [MrBayes](http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/), [BEAST](https://github.com/beast-dev/beast-mcmc), [BEAST2](https://www.beast2.org/), [RevBayes](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes), [Migrate](http://popgen.sc.fsu.edu/Migrate/Migrate-n.html), [LAMARC](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/lamarc/index.html) and and possibly other MCMC programs from other domains..

### Downloading

You can download Tracer 1.7 from here: [https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/latest](https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/latest)

### Using Tracer

A tutorial is available describing [how to use Tracer to analyse the output from BEAST](analysing_beast_output).

Another tutorial focuses on [how to identify convergence problems using Tracer](tracer_convergence).
