## Markov-modulated Models Tutorial

A Markov-modulated model (MMM) is an extension of the standard nucleotide substitution model that allows the substitution process at a site to change over time.




## Prerequisites

This tutorial requires that you have a standard BEAST XML, as for example generated by BEAUti using an HKY or GTR model, at the ready.





## Adjusting the data type of the analysis





## Specifying the Markov-modulated model





## Bayesian model selection
