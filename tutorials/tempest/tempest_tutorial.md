## Building a non-molecular clock tree

## Running TempEst and loading the tree

{% include icon-callout.html file='icons/tempest-icon.png' content='Run <a href="tempest">TempEst</a> by double clicking on its icon. TempEst is an interactive graphical application for examining the temporal signal in a tree of time-stamped sequences by plotting the divergence of each tip from the root against the date of sampling (a root-to-tip plot).' %}


Once running, TempEst will look similar irrespective of which computer system it is running on. For this tutorial, the Mac OS X version will be shown but the Linux & Windows versions will have exactly the same layout and functionality.

When started, TempEst will immediately display a file selection dialog box in which you can select the tree that you made in the previous section.
