## Introduction
Discarding the need to download any software, SPREAD 4 is a major update to [SpreaD3](spread3). This version of SPREAD is online and allows the users to simply log on to their uploaded files and visualize the phylogeographic spread using a URL link with any desired browser. The analyses that can be visualized in SPREAD are typically obtained using [BEAST](about). However, it can also accommodate input generated by other phylogenetic inference tools, as long as the nodes and branches are annotated using the compatible syntax.
